    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Adventure Time is an animated cartoon series created by Pendleton Ward for the Cartoon Network. It is a story about a boy and his dog in a mystical land called Oo, and they run around killing monsters and helping people. This show has themes that both children and adults alike can enjoy.</p>
    <p>Because the series is a childrenâ€™s series I hand cut my typography out of construction paper. I decided that each page would be a quote from a different character and the design would represent their colour and their personalities.</p>
