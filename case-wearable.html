    <h3>App Definition</h3>
    <p>The main need of the user is to make fast payments to suit their busy life. I chose to do this because now-a-days there are so many different cards that we have to keep in our wallet. Users need something that can group them all together and make identifying themself fast and at the tap of their finger.</p>
    <h3>Target Audience: Young Adults</h3>
    <p>Users are always on the go, and live a fast paced life. They need products that can work in the background, because they already have too many things to do. The products that they would be most interested in would be a simple product that could do it all.</p>

    <h5 class="margin-0">NFC ring:</h3>
    <p>this ring is used to share information along to other people. There is a public information side, and private information side. The public side is for social media, email addresses. The private side can hold payment information, phone locking systems, as well as locking systems for your home</p>
    <h5 class="margin-0">Kerv:</h5>
    <p>Works in partnership with the NFC ring. The main difference is Kerv works mostly on the private information. This can also be used to validate you on public transit.</p>

  <div class="island-quarter unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2">
    <h4>Technology</h4>
    <p>All the competitors you NFC technology within their products. But this can cause bulkiness as well as limits the options for uses of their products. The best alternative to use is Radio-frequency identification (RFID). This is what they use for the tap systems on credit cards, this chip is the size of a grain of rice. Using radio frequency they can pass information onto systems that have RFID frequencies.</p>
    <p>Credit cards use EMV technology which use the RFID technology to pass information. There are many things you can do with this information transfer such as access control, advertising, human/animal identification, public transport, hospital and healthcare.</p>
