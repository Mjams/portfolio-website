    <h3>App Definition</h3>
    <p>The need of the user is to satisfy their thirst, hunger and energy boost (that coffee would supply). Coffee fix would allow you to purchase your coffee ahead of time and have it ready when you pick it up.</p>
    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>The users of my product range from young adults to adults. They are always on the run, and they seem to be rushing everywhere to be on time. They are always busy between attending class, work, meetings etc. Of course they have needs like everyone else, they need food and drinks, and many of them do need their coffee.</p>

    <h4>Apps on the Market</h4>
    <h5 class="margin-0">Starbucks:</h5>
    <p>Their app makes it easy and fast to pay for your drinks and food. You can order ahead of time and pick up your drinks without waiting in line. You can even tip your barista, in the process.</p>
    <h5 class="margin-0">Grubhub:</h5>
    <p>Order food through this app. You can order both pickup and delivery. Enter your location and it will find the restaurants that are close to you. You can check out the menus, order, and even pay (with credit, paypal or cash) on this app. The special feature that this app allows for you id to search a specific food item and it will show you that food item that many different places might have

    <h4>What Makes Coffee Time Different</h4>
    <p>The issue with apps on the market today is how bombarded they are with many features that have mediocre results. Starbuck app is only for their chain and no other coffee chains. My app would cover local coffee shops as well as multiple chain coffee shops.</p>
    <p>Many of the pickup and delivery apps have many issues with the delivery part of the application. Deliveries do not always show up, or are extremely late and the food is cold by the time that they get there. My app would focus solely on the order being placed and prepared for the person to pick up. </p>
